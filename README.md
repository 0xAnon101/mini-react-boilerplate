# react-mini-boilerplate
A custom react boilerplate for creating your React Projects.

Initially it was just a boilerplate that could be cloned and changed to jump-start a react application, with a basic and easy 
config that provides enough for a small project to work and requires little gradual tinkering to expand beyond the basics.

I keep the minimal config exposed so anyone could analyse and study it, play with it, and improve it.

## Usage
- Copy and paste ```git clone https://github.com/GAUTAMRAJU15/mini-react-boilerplate.git```
- Then, Do ```npm install``` and you will get a nice minimal boilerplate to code on and later on you can add your own loaders and plugins according to your application needs.
