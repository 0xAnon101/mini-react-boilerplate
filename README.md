# mini-react-boilerplate
A custom react boilerplate , rather than create-react-app
Initially it was just a boilerplate that could be cloned and changed to jump-start a react application, with a basic and easy 
config that provides enough for a small projectto work and requires little gradual tinkering to expand beyond the basics.

I keep the minimal config exposed so anyone could analyse and study it, play with it, and improve it.
I always change it on my own projects to be more specific. Adding this to the core package would only increase the complexity 
quite a lot, and I want to keep it as minimal and functional as possible on the boilerplate.
