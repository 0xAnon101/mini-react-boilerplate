# react-mini-boilerplate
A custom react boilerplate for creating your React Projects.

Initially it was just a boilerplate that could be cloned and changed to jump-start a react application, with a basic and easy 
config that provides enough for a small project to work and requires little gradual tinkering to expand beyond the basics.

I keep the minimal config exposed so anyone could analyse and study it, play with it, and improve it.
I always change it on my own projects to be more specific. Adding this to the core package would only increase the complexity 
quite a lot, and I want to keep it as minimal and functional as possible on the boilerplate.

## What to do ?
- Do ```npm install``` and you will get a nice minimal boilerplate to code on and later on you can add your own loaders and plugins according to your application needs.
